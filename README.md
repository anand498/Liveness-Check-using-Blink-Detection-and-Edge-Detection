# Liveness-Check-using-Blink-Detection-and-Edge-Detection
An implementation of face spoof detection using blink detection and edge detection.

This project is for the liveness detection of a Face using Webcam as well as a
pre-captured video of a person.

There are two phases to this project

External requirements to this project:
shape predictor file
test video file(preferably in mp4 format)

The first phase is to check using blink detection.
Over here the shape predictor dat file and the video file parameters should 
be entered into the code.
Then run the main.py file.

The method in which it works is by  taking the video in the form of a filestream
and checking the t
*This file will will be ready after 3-4 days.
